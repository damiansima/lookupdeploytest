lookupdeploytest
================

This is a DEMO app to show the capablities of the lookup manager in CloudHub.
The idea is that this app is to be deployed in cloud hub and the lookups will be created in the lookup manager 
space related to the app and all its initial data will be uploaded.

As of this moment the lookup manager has no UI, so there is another iAPP to provide that.
